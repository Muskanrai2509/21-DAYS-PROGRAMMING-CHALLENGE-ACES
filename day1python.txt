Python is an object-oriented programming language created by Guido Rossum in 1989.
Python programming is widely used in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Generation, Neural Networks and other advanced fields of Computer Science. Python had deep focus on code readability & this class will teach you python from basics.


Variables:
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. Variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.
Ex-
# Declare a variable and initialize it
f = 0
print f
# re-declaring the variable works
f = 'python'
print f
Ex-
f = 101
print f
# Global vs. local variables in functions
def someFunction():
# global f
    f = 'I am learning Python'
    print f
someFunction()
print f

Delete a variable:
You can also delete variable using the command del "variable name".

In the example below, we deleted variable f, and when we proceed to print it, we get error "variable name is not defined" which means you have deleted the variable.
f = 11;
print(f)
del f
print(f)

Summary:

In Python you cannot concatenate string with number directly, you need to declare them as a separate variable, and after that, you can concatenate number with string
Declare local variable when you want to use it for current function
Declare Global variable when you want to use the same variable for rest of the program
To delete a variable, it uses keyword "del".

Operators:-
Operators in a programming language are used to perform various operations
There are various methods for arithmetic calculation in Python as you can use the eval function, declare variable & calculate, or call functions
Comparison operators often referred as relational operators are used to compare the values on either side of them and determine the relation between them
Python assignment operators are simply to assign the value to variable
Python also allows you to use a compound assignment operator, in a complicated arithmetic calculation, where you can assign the result of one operand to the other
For AND operator – It returns TRUE if both the operands (right side and left side) are true
For OR operator- It returns TRUE if either of the operand (right side or left side) is true
For NOT operator- returns TRUE if operand is false
There are two membership operators that are used in Python. (in, not in).
It gives the result based on the variable present in specified sequence or string
The two identify operators used in Python are (is, is not)
It returns true if two variables point the same object and false otherwise
Precedence operator can be useful when you have to set priority for which calculation need to be done first in a complex calculation 

Ex-
#Arithmetic Operators
x= 4	
y= 5
print x + y

#Comparison Operators
x = 4
y = 5
print('x > y  is',x>y)

#Assignment Operators
num1 = 4
num2 = 5
print ("Line 1 - Value of num1 : ", num1)
print ("Line 2 - Value of num2 : ", num2)

#compound assignment operator
num1 = 4
num2 = 5
res = num1 + num2
res += num1
print ("Line 1 - Result of + is ", res)

#Logical Operators
a = True
b = False
print('a and b is',a and b)
print('a or b is',a or b)
print('not a is',not a)

#Membership Operators
x = 4
y = 8
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
if ( x in list ):
   print "Line 1 - x is available in the given list"
else:
   print "Line 1 - x is not available in the given list"
if ( y not in list ):
   print "Line 2 - y is not available in the given list"
else:
   print "Line 2 - y is available in the given list"

#Identity Operators
x = 20
y = 20
if ( x is y ):
	print "x & y  SAME identity"
y=30
if ( x is not y ):
	print "x & y have DIFFERENT identity"

#Operator precedence
v = 4
w = 5
x = 8
y = 2
z = 0
z = (v+w) * x / y;   
print "Value of (v+w) * x/ y is ",  z
